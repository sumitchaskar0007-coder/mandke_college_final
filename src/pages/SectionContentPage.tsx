                  <p>
                    Today's education is a good mix of theoretical and practical knowledge. However, when it comes to
                    applying this knowledge in an industry environment, many students find themselves lacking in the
                    in-depth knowledge of practical application.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To tackle this problem and make individuals "industry ready", MHHF started the Mandke Institute for
                    Learning Employable Skills (MILES).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    MILES, along with its in-house courses, has collaborated with many institutions to provide a wide
                    range of industry-relevant, skill-based courses where training is provided at low cost with
                    assistance for job placement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These courses allow an individual to stand out from the crowd, gain self confidence, become self
                    sufficient and, most importantly, apply oneself gainfully, resulting in a better society as a whole.

                      College Events & Fests provide students with an opportunity to showcase their talents. As students
                      perform in front of live audiences, they experience a boost in their confidence levels. College
                      fests are crucial to shape the overall personality of students.

                      Cultural events serve as a way to bring together students, teachers, and families from diverse
                      backgrounds. When students actively participate in cultural events, they have the chance to
                      collaborate, learn from one another, and build meaningful relationships.

                      Celebrating the Jayanti & Punyatithi of important individuals is a way of recognising their
                      contributions and their impact on our lives. It is a way to remember them respectfully and learn
                      more about them.
